An alternative client for Tinder. Automatically swipes left on obvious spam-bots. Swipe left and right with the arrow keys.

## Installation

To natively run an ES6 file in Node you must one of the latest version (the "stable" version, which is in the Ubuntu repositories, doesn't work at this time of writing.)
